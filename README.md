# Color-Schemer
Create pleasing palettes based on color theory. Schemer includes a demo to help evaluate whether pretty equals practical.

### Development

The copy-to-clipboard feature by ZeroClipboard.js utilizes flash (html5 method coming soon). Schemer is mobile friendly, but flash is not (sadface). To develop and test copy-to-clipboard locally, run a server such as... 

`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

### Credit

This project utilizes a library called color-scheme.js (based on a perl module) and borrows heavily from its demonstration. I aimed to simplify the results and create consistent four color palettes. I added a demonstration to help a user evaluate the colors in use. Check it out: https://github.com/c0bra/color-scheme-js/
